# 🚀 FailForward

**FailForward** is a community-driven platform where founders, developers, and dreamers share their stories of failed startups — not to mourn them, but to extract the lessons, challenges, and raw truths behind every shutdown.

The goal is to create a transparent archive of startup journeys that didn’t make it — so future entrepreneurs can avoid the same pitfalls and build better.
